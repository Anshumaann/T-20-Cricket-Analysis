# T-20-Cricket-Analysis
Get ready for a cricket journey like never before! In this project, we've dived into the T20 World Cup 2022 data from espncricinfo. Using easy-to-understand magic from Pandas, we've sorted and cleaned the numbers so you can easily catch the coolest player stats.

Project Fun Stuff:
Pandas Power: We've used a tool called Pandas that makes numbers play nice and tidy.
Excel High-Five: Excel, your trusty sidekick, helped us organize things even more neatly.
Power BI Showtime: With the help of Power BI, we've created colorful dashboards that tell the cricket story in a way even non-number people can cheer for!
